1) In this workshop the key to linking related data is the index of the array. That is what I used to store the data in the array, for example I used a for loop that iterates starting with zero. Array indexes also start with 0 so I do something like array[i] so it adds data to parallel arrays with same indexes.

2) It is good practice to that because both array indexes and iterations usually start with a 0. An example from my workshop is me setting a i to a value of 0. It makes it easier to link it to arrays because they also start with an index of 0. While i iterates the array cycles along with it.

3) If I am to exaplain the concept of arrays to a child, I would tell them it would be similar to an apartment floor. The data inside the array will be the people who live inside the apartments. In this example the apartment number would be the array index.
