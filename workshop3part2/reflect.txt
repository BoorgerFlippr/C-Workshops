1) In order to assign an integer value to a particular month, a selection construct such as if statements and switch must be used. If you want to use an if statement to achieve this process it would go like this
		
		if (num == 1)
		 {
			printf("JAN");
		 }
	    else if (num == 2)
		 {
			printf("FEB");
		 }

    A switch case would go like this

	     switch (month)
		{
		case 1: printf("JAN"); 
		break;
		case 2: printf("FEB"); 
		break;
		}

2) The three types of iteration constructs are while, do while and for loops. For this workshop I used a do while loop to validate user entered values. It is a good choice because I don't know how many times the loop will iterate. I also favoured this choice over the while loop because the integration is simpler.

3) In order to debug and test my program I keep entering values and making sure that the output of the entered values is correct. I also employedthe error list at the bottom of the screen to help me locate errors within the program.
