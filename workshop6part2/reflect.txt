1) The reportData structures has atleast 60 bytes of memory. Passing memory can be improved by putting all data required in struct, that way all the bytes needed will be condensed there. Using pass by reference also imprves passing memory because instead of it copying the data, it chnages the original directly, therefore greatly reducing the number of bytes required for the reportData function;

2) I would change the ReportData structure to something like this:

typedef struct {
	CatFoodInfo;
	double weightKG;
	int weightG;
	double totalServing;
	double costPerServing;
	double costofcalPerserving;
} ReportData;

And in order to modify the printf statement that shows the data, I would change it to this:

CatFoodData f;
printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf\n\n", r.f.sku, r.f.price, r.f.productWeightPounds, r.weightKG, r.weightG, r.f.calPerServing, r.totalServing, r.costPerServing, r.costofcalPerserving);
