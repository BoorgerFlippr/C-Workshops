Reflection

1) In this workshop I have leared many things. One of the things I have learned working on this workshop is how to create a basic C program. I was able to make use of the print function and have a general idea of what goes in and out of a C program. I also learned how to transfer my files to matrix using an SFTP such as winSCP

2) SSH or secure shell protocol is an application that allows the user to connect to a secure server such as Seneca College's Matrix. In this workshop, I used an SSH in order to connect to Matrix so I can submit this week's workshop. In order to connect to an SSH, I used an application called putty.

3) SFTP or secure file transfer protocol is an applicaton that allows us to transfer and access files from an secure server. WinSCP is the application I used in order to perform that function. I used an SFTP client to transfer my workshop from my computer to matrix.
